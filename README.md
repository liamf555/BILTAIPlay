## Example prompts

Processing:

Write a Processing script to make a 3D visualisation with moving and colour changing procedural patterns, that reacts to the mouse cursor. The patterns should be inspired by the work of Piet Mondrian, with red, yellow, blue, black and white cuboids and solid black lines to produce different-sized shapes. Provide only the code. Use only default libraries.

Pygame:

Write a python script to use the pygame library to make a basic 2D clone of flappy bird. Control using the keyboard, pressing the spacebar causes the bird to 'flap' and gain height, but it has to act against gravity. Use basic geometric shapes to render the aircraft and pipes. Make the bird yellow and the pipes green. Start the game paused, pressing the spacebar starts the game.
